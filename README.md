## In the jungle, mighty jungle, I am resting on LLM branch

- [ ] 21 May 2025 > I rejected L200 idea assigned to me. I do not know where do I fit mulmodality in Business APIs development as of now. If I would have followed the crowd assignments, I wouldn't have the glowing skin and magical hair. You can sense from the expression that I am hating L200 idea as I am an Ace already with 15 years of experience, and bam! I felt on the floor like those snakes and ladders situation here. People do that at office, cuties do not understand as they are beginning, others take advantages. I felt like those uncles who used to get political inneundos to offguard them from their projects or assignments. Here it goes again, I started with LLM journey a month ago and in the middle, as usual, another hurdle. I hate when people are not adept at LLM are assigned with jobs to teach others LLM. How to tell them technopreneurs know everything...
